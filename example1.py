# def : tells us that a function is being defined
#     : it is followed by the function name and input parameters
#     : the name must meet the same criteria as naming variables
# all the commands within the function are indented to indicate
# the function block of commands
# the input parameter is required, and is a variable that can be
# used inside the function
# the return value is sent back to the main block of code
# notice the use of comments to indicate what the input parameters are
# as well as what the output is
